Revision history for Catalyst-Plugin-CDBI-Transaction

0.03    12 Oct 2005
        Bug fix: Depending on how many CDBI classes were returned by
        $c->components, not all localizations of AutoCommit were being
        restored after the coderef executed, thus effectively failing to
        commit the entire transaction.
        Added a test Catalyst application for actual tests of the plugin.
        Small correction to the create() method in the SYNOPSIS section of the
        documentation.
0.02    14 Sep 2005
        Bug fix.  Class::DBI model components don't always stringify to their
        class names.  Used ref() to ensure we always get the CDBI class name
        before attempting to zero its AutoCommit.

0.01    22 Jun 2005
        First version, released on a (mostly) unsuspecting world.
