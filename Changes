Revision history for Catalyst-Plugin-CDBI-Transaction

0.02    14 Sep 2005
        Bug fix.  Class::DBI model components don't always stringify to their
        class names.  Used ref() to ensure we always get the CDBI class name
        before attempting to zero its AutoCommit.

0.01    22 Jun 2005
        First version, released on a (mostly) unsuspecting world.
